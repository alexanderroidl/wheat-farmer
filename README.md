# 1. The Game
**The game is currently at early alpha developing stage**, meaning it is neither complete, nor bug-free.

**Implemented mechanics:**
- Gather wheat by planting your seeds and waiting on your crops to growth, harvesting them upon completion ✅ 
- Avoid hostile robot attacks while farming ✅

**Road map:**
* Sell harvested wheat for currency ❌
* Trade currency for armed defenses ❌
* Automate farming by upgrading technology ❌
